## 2.2 Review of Related Research Studies

### 2.2.1 Global Burden of Dental Caries in Children

Dental caries remains the most prevalent chronic disease affecting children worldwide, posing significant public health challenges. According to the World Health Organization (2022), untreated dental caries in permanent teeth is the most common health condition globally, with approximately 514 million children affected by caries in primary teeth. The Global Burden of Disease Study 2021 indicates a continued increase in the global burden of early childhood caries (ECC), particularly in low- and middle-income countries where limited access to dental care exacerbates the problem (Chen et al., 2025).

A systematic review with meta-analysis by Uribe et al. (2021) examined the global prevalence of early childhood caries using WHO diagnostic criteria. The study found that ECC affects nearly half of preschool children globally, with prevalence rates ranging from 12% to 98% depending on the region. The age-specific prevalence showed a progressive increase: 17% at age 1, 36% at age 2, 43% at age 3, 55% at age 4, and 63% at age 5 years. This escalating pattern underscores the critical importance of early intervention and preventive education.

In the Malaysian context, research has documented concerning oral health statistics among children. Mohd Nor et al. (2020) conducted a cross-sectional study among 396 Malaysian preschoolers aged 3-6 years and found that 63.4% had at least one untreated caries, with a mean decayed teeth (dt) score of 3.56. The study identified significant associations between dental caries and nutritional status, sugar consumption, and exposure to secondhand smoke. Among indigenous (Orang Asli) children aged 11-12 years, the prevalence of caries reached 61.6% with an additional 96% prevalence of gingivitis (Abdul Kadir et al., 2019).

These statistics highlight the urgent need for effective oral health interventions targeting children. The World Health Assembly responded by adopting a Resolution on oral health in 2021, recommending a shift from curative to preventive approaches that promote oral health within families, schools, and communities (WHO, 2022).

### 2.2.2 The Imperative for Improved Oral Health Education and Digital Interventions

Good oral hygiene is fundamental to maintaining oral health and serves as a cornerstone for overall well-being. It prevents problems like tooth decay and periodontal diseases, sustains chewing ability, prevents bad breath, and enhances personal confidence and social interactions (Romalee et al., 2023). However, a significant number of individuals continue to suffer from oral diseases primarily due to incorrect or inadequate knowledge and inappropriate skills in oral care (Chang et al., 2021).

Traditional educational approaches, such as passive lecture-based programs, have shown limitations in effectively delivering oral healthcare education and developing self-care skills, particularly for children who require more engaging and interactive learning methods (Romalee et al., 2023). Even with regular professional reminders, changing patients' oral hygiene behavior remains challenging. Poor adherence to oral health instructions is a common barrier to proper care, often stemming from difficulty recalling the information received during dental visits.

In response to these challenges, mobile applications have been identified as valuable intervention tools for improving self-care efficiency and health service delivery. The potential of app-based interventions in promoting health and well-being has led to an exponential increase in the number of health-related apps (Romalee et al., 2023). For children specifically, mobile health (mHealth) applications offer unique advantages including accessibility, interactivity, and the ability to incorporate game-like elements that appeal to young users.

### 2.2.3 Gamification in Children's Oral Health Applications

Gamification refers to the application of game design elements and mechanics in non-game contexts to increase engagement, motivation, and behavioral change (Deterding et al., 2011). In the context of children's health, gamification has demonstrated significant promise for promoting positive behaviors and improving health outcomes.

A systematic review published in the Journal of Medical Internet Research by Tezcan et al. (2025) synthesized findings from 41 studies on gamification in children's oral health management. The review found that gamified interventions, particularly those incorporating digital technologies such as mobile apps and AR, showed significant improvements in children's oral health knowledge, brushing behaviors, and plaque control. Experimental studies consistently demonstrated that gamified interventions significantly improved oral health behaviors and engagement, with gamified mobile health app groups showing superior plaque control (P<.05) compared to non-gamified control groups.

Schwarz et al. (2020) conducted a systematic search of app stores to identify mobile applications with gamification features focused on motivating children to learn and maintain optimal oral hygiene. The study identified 17 mobile apps with gamification features, with gamification components averaging 6.87 out of 31 possible features. The most commonly identified gamification features were "time pressure" and "audible feedback" in the form of songs that help children practice oral healthcare correctly. The Toothsavers Brushing Game scored highest in app quality and behavior change techniques. However, the study noted that less than 20% of apps included comprehensive oral hygiene education beyond brushing, indicating significant gaps in existing applications.

A randomized controlled trial by Zotti et al. (2021) designed a gamified smartphone application and assessed its efficacy for oral health education. The study compared a simple app with a gamified version and found that children had significantly better plaque control in the gamified app group (P < 0.05). After one month, the gamified app effectively improved oral health knowledge and practice, while oral hygiene outcomes were superior in children using the gamified version.

Research on gamified health interventions has consistently demonstrated high effectiveness rates. A scoping review on gamified eHealth interventions found that 80% of studies demonstrated effectiveness in improving health-related knowledge, motivation, and attitude outcomes among children and adolescents (Wang et al., 2025). The Self-Determination Theory (SDT) was the most commonly used theoretical framework (32% of studies), emphasizing the importance of addressing intrinsic motivation in gamification design.

Key gamification elements that have shown effectiveness in children's health applications include:
- **Points and Rewards:** Providing immediate feedback and recognition for desired behaviors
- **Progression Systems:** Levels, ranks, or stages that create a sense of achievement and advancement
- **Streaks:** Consecutive day counters that encourage habit formation through consistency
- **Badges/Achievements:** Visual representations of accomplishments that provide long-term motivation
- **Challenges/Missions:** Specific tasks that provide clear goals and direction
- **Feedback:** Immediate responses to actions that reinforce learning and behavior

### 2.2.4 Augmented Reality (AR) in Education and Oral Health

Augmented Reality (AR) is a technology that integrates digital information into the real-world environment, allowing users to interact with virtual objects overlaid onto physical surroundings (Romalee et al., 2023). Mobile Augmented Reality (MAR) refers to AR applications accessible via commonly used portable devices such as smartphones and tablets, making the technology accessible to a wide audience including children.

A comprehensive meta-analysis by Garzón et al. (2022) reviewed 134 quasi-experimental studies on augmented reality in education from 2012 to 2021. The findings suggest that AR technology benefits all three levels of learning outcomes: response (attitudes and motivation), knowledge and skill acquisition, and performance. The study found larger mean effect sizes on performance-based outcomes, indicating that AR is particularly effective for practical skill development. Meta-regression results identified treatment duration as a significant factor, with AR used for language and social studies showing higher positive learner responses compared to science learning alone.

For young children specifically, AR has demonstrated effectiveness in creating realistic and enjoyable learning environments. Safar et al. (2022) found that AR captivates children by merging play with learning, enabling interactive engagement in educational settings. The technology facilitates a seamless blend of physical and virtual information, fostering children's ability to adapt to combined realities. A randomized controlled trial by Li et al. (2024) evaluated AR games for children's education and found that the intervention group receiving 20 minutes of AR-based learning showed significantly greater performance on both immediate and delayed recognition tests compared to control groups.

In the context of oral health education, AR has been utilized for visualization of anatomical structures and simulation of dental concepts. Romalee et al. (2023) conducted a pilot study examining Mobile AR-integrated oral health education and reported notable improvements in oral health knowledge and self-efficacy. The MAR system featured interactive 3D animations and instructional content related to oral hygiene practices. The technology's core strength lies in its ability to present complex information visually and interactively, making abstract concepts like tooth anatomy, plaque accumulation, and decay progression tangible and understandable for users.

For the ToothyMate application, AR is implemented as a tool to display an interactive 3D tooth model with discoverable dental cases. This allows children to explore various aspects of tooth anatomy and common dental conditions through manipulation of the 3D model with gesture controls. This visual and immersive approach aligns with children's learning preferences and makes dental education more intuitive and engaging.

However, despite its potential, AR systems have occasionally received lower usability ratings in some studies (Romalee et al., 2023). This highlights the importance of optimizing user interface design and interaction flow to ensure that educational benefits are not undermined by technical complexity. ToothyMate addresses this by incorporating intuitive gesture controls and child-friendly visual design in its AR module.

### 2.2.5 Artificial Intelligence for Dental Image Classification

Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the ability of machines to imitate human intelligence and behavior through programmed algorithms, with machine learning and deep learning being key applications (Tay et al., 2023). AI has significantly influenced the dental healthcare field across diverse applications, including radiographic and photographic diagnosis.

A landmark diagnostic study by Kühnisch et al. (2022) demonstrated the feasibility of using AI, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), for detecting and categorizing caries on intraoral photographs with high accuracy, achieving over 90% agreement for overall caries detection. This provides strong evidence that AI can effectively analyze visual data from teeth, with potential applications for both clinical diagnosis and educational feedback systems.

Recent research has specifically examined AI applications for children's dental health. Alharbi et al. (2024) developed a deep learning approach for automatic tooth caries segmentation in panoramic radiographs of children across primary, mixed, and permanent dentition stages. Using an Attention U-Net architecture, the study achieved sensitivity of 0.8269, precision of 0.9123, and F1 score of 0.8675, demonstrating that deep learning-based AI models are promising tools for caries detection in pediatric populations.

A systematic review and meta-analysis by Tay et al. (2023) on artificial intelligence in oral hygiene education assessed trends, ethical considerations, and technology use across 20 studies. The review found that AI is practical for daily oral health applications and can be effectively combined with AR/VR technologies. AI-assisted feedback can be categorized into synchronous monitoring (real-time data from intelligent devices) and asynchronous monitoring (imaging after oral hygiene practices via smartphone cameras), with the latter being more accessible for consumer applications.

The integration of AI for dental condition classification in consumer applications must consider several factors:

**Image Quality:** High-quality, standardized photographs are essential for effective AI analysis. Poor image quality due to focus issues, overexposure, glare, or low resolution can negatively affect detection performance (Tay et al., 2023).

**Classification Categories:** For educational, non-diagnostic purposes, AI models should focus on commonly visible conditions that users can understand and act upon. These include:
- Calculus (tartar/plaque buildup)
- Caries (cavities/tooth decay)
- Stains (discoloration)
- Healthy teeth
- Invalid images (not teeth)

**On-Device Processing:** TensorFlow Lite enables deployment of machine learning models directly on mobile devices, providing privacy benefits (no data transmission), offline functionality, and faster inference times. Studies have demonstrated effective model training using TensorFlow and Keras libraries for dental applications (Ahmad et al., 2024).

**Ethical Considerations:** The implementation of AI in healthcare raises important ethical concerns including patient privacy protection and the "black-box" problem where AI decision-making processes may be opaque (Tay et al., 2023). For consumer applications, transparency about the non-diagnostic nature of AI feedback and clear disclaimers about seeking professional dental care are essential.

### 2.2.6 Impact of Mobile Applications on Oral Hygiene Practices

Two key studies provide strong evidence for the positive impact of mobile applications on oral hygiene behaviors:

**The "Dent-O-Xpert" Smartphone Application (Nagarajappa et al., 2023):**
A randomized controlled trial demonstrated the effectiveness of the Dent-O-Xpert smartphone application in significantly improving oral health-related knowledge, attitude, and behavior among young adults. The intervention led to significant reductions in both plaque and oral hygiene scores. Notably, the app increased toothbrushing frequency, with 96.4% of participants reporting brushing twice daily by the second follow-up, up from 70.2% at baseline. The app also improved brushing techniques, showing a significant increase in adoption of the Modified Bass technique to approximately 59.5%. The success was attributed to comprehensive features including educational content, interactive modules, daily push notifications, reminders, demonstrative videos, and personalized recommendations.

**Oral Self-Care App (OSCA) (Chang et al., 2021):**
The OSCA was developed based on the Behavior Change Wheel (BCW) framework to engage participants and facilitate behavioral change. The study found a significant correlation between Oral Hygiene Status (OHS) improvement and frequency of app use, with high-frequency users demonstrating greater improvement. The study emphasized the importance of capability establishment (providing knowledge and skills), motivation enhancement, and opportunity creation (setting reminders) in app design.

These studies collectively demonstrate that mobile applications with comprehensive features, interactive elements, and regular engagement mechanisms can effectively improve oral hygiene knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors. The frequency of app use is positively correlated with improved outcomes, highlighting the importance of sustained engagement—a key consideration for ToothyMate's gamification design.

## 2.3 Existing Mobile Applications Related to Oral Health

Several mobile applications currently aim to promote oral hygiene, provide education, or assist in behavior change. However, most do not integrate AR, AI classification, gamification, and comprehensive e-learning within a single platform designed specifically for children. The following are among the most relevant existing applications:

### 2.3.1 Brush DJ

Brush DJ is a music-based application designed to encourage users to brush for the recommended two-minute duration by playing music from the user's device. It also offers reminders for dental visits and flossing. While suitable for basic behavior encouragement and widely recommended by dental professionals, the app lacks personalized feedback, comprehensive educational content, progress tracking features, gamification elements, and modern enhancements such as AI or AR. It is not specifically designed for children's engagement needs.

### 2.3.2 Oral-B App

Developed by Procter & Gamble, the Oral-B app works with Bluetooth-enabled electric toothbrushes to guide users with AI-generated real-time feedback. It provides brushing time tracking, zone-based scoring, and pressure monitoring. The app encourages habit formation through gamified brushing goals. However, it requires specific Oral-B devices, significantly limiting accessibility. It does not include educational resources tailored for children, AR features for interactive learning, or standalone AI classification capabilities without proprietary hardware.

### 2.3.3 Pokemon Smile

Pokemon Smile is a children's brushing app that uses AR to overlay Pokemon characters on the user's face during brushing. Children can "catch" Pokemon by brushing properly. The app successfully uses gamification and AR to engage children during brushing. However, it focuses solely on the brushing activity itself without providing educational content about oral health, AI-based feedback on dental conditions, or comprehensive lesson modules. It serves as a brushing timer with AR entertainment rather than an educational oral health platform.

### 2.3.4 Colgate Connect

The Colgate Connect app provides brushing guidance, habit tracking, and gamification features for users of Colgate smart toothbrushes. It includes some educational content and personalized recommendations. However, like the Oral-B app, it requires proprietary hardware, lacks AR visualization features, does not include AI-based image classification for dental conditions, and is not specifically designed with children's educational needs as the primary focus.

### 2.3.5 Dent AI

Dent AI is a mobile application developed by Openuse.io released in 2025, designed to support dental professionals in clinical documentation, diagnosis assistance, and secure communication. The app incorporates AI for interpreting dental X-rays and streamlining patient management. While technologically advanced in its AI capabilities, it is intended for clinical professional use rather than public engagement or children's education. It lacks AR features, gamification elements, and is not designed for behavior change or daily self-monitoring by general users or children.

## 2.6 Chapter Summary

This chapter has reviewed the relevant literature on children's oral health status, gamification in health applications, augmented reality in education, and artificial intelligence for dental image classification. The review establishes that:

1. Dental caries remains a significant global health burden among children, with particularly high prevalence in Malaysia, necessitating effective preventive interventions.

2. Traditional oral health education methods are insufficient for engaging children and producing lasting behavioral change, creating a need for innovative digital solutions.

3. Gamification has demonstrated consistent effectiveness in improving children's health behaviors, with key elements including points, progression systems, streaks, badges, and challenges.

4. Augmented Reality technology positively impacts learning outcomes and is particularly effective for interactive visualization and engaging young learners.

5. Artificial Intelligence, specifically deep learning models, can accurately classify dental conditions from photographs, with potential applications for educational feedback systems.

6. Existing oral health mobile applications have limitations in their integration of multiple technologies and their specific design for children's needs.

The identified gaps in the literature and existing applications provide the rationale for developing ToothyMate as an integrated platform combining gamification, AR, and AI within a child-friendly oral health education application. The next chapter describes the methodology adopted for developing the ToothyMate application.
